Battleship is a simple grid based (2D array) game that you can play against the computer.

This is the first oop version of Battleship that I've written and the first OOP app I've written ever.  
I've rewritten it three times:

1v: procedural(mostly)		https://github.com/winterfive/Microsoft_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship

2v: first oop	      here: https://github.com/winterfive/Battleship

3v: second oop    https://github.com/winterfive/learning_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship_updated


In writing each version, I've applied knowledge gained from creating the previous version.
